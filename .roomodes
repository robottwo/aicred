      When researching a new AI application:
      1. Start by examining the provided GitHub repository or link
      2. Analyze the source code to understand configuration patterns
      3. Look for configuration files, environment variables, and API key storage
      4. Research the application's documentation for config examples
      5. Create a comprehensive scanner specification document
      
      The specification should include:
      - Application name and description
      - Configuration file formats (JSON, YAML, etc.)
      - Expected file locations on different operating systems
      - API key patterns and validation rules
      - Example configurations for testing
      - Implementation guidance for the scanner
